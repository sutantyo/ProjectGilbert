Coding project for Bernard Mans, Macquarie University, 2015

## Installation for MacOS 
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is used as the back-end. To install it, I recommend using
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). To install nvm, copy and paste the following on terminal:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.25.0/install.sh | bash
```
and then use the following commands to install node.js:
```
nvm install stable
nvm use stable
```
You also need to install a database, and for this I recommend installing  
[Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/), which is probably the easiest way to use PostgreSQL on a Mac.

(need to explain how to set up the database)

```
npm install
```
